    "text": "Overview\nUrban Sensing With Satellites - Jurong Lake District is a project under the module SMT201 Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning by Professor Kam Tin Seong in Singapore Management University (SMU).\nThe development of Jurong Lake District (JLD) is a stark contrast against Singapore’s long standing issues surrounding high rates of deforestation island-wide, which reached a total tree cover loss of 1.4% from 2002 - 2021. JLD is instead set to be not only Singapore’s 2nd city centre, but also a model of urban sustainability under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Its immense importance and potential as a turning point in Singapore’s future development towards a more sustainable city has motivated our team to choose it as our prime area of analysis. \nTherefore, the objectives of our project are as follows:\n\nTo detect land cover change (how much vegetation has been lost to development) from 2018-2022 in JLD using Sentinel-2 data.\nTo recommend suitable strategies to reduce forested land loss in JLD based on insights from our analysis.\n\nAs for our methodology, instead of solely using the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP), we aim to explore a different method of classification using the Dzetsaka Plugin. We will then be able to validate said method by generating an accuracy report. This will supplement our main classification report, which depicts the exact percentage and area of each assigned class (water, vegetation, built-up, bare land, impervious surfaces).\nOur key findings include a clear inverse relationship between vegetation and built-up areas, observed as a decrease in vegetation area by 3.08km² and increase in built-up area by 4.05km². This is to be expected, given that land in Jurong Lake District is being zoned for transformation into the largest mixed-use business district outside of the city centre. To achieve URA’s vision for JLD as a sustainable urban hub, a balance must be struck between the preservation of existing greenery and the development of new built areas. This will minimise disruptions to the local biodiversity and reduce urban heat, all while acting as protection for the mental well-being of the local populace."

    "text": "What about Singapore’s greenery landscape?\nOver the last century, Singapore has lost over 90% of its original forestry to colonial profiteering, urbanisation and industrialisation. Tied with this is probably the loss of many species of plants and animals indigenous to Singapore (Kopi, n.d.). Deforestation and the loss of greenery has been a consistent problem even for the tiny island known as the “Garden City”. From 2002 to 2021, Singapore lost 37ha of humid primary forest, making up 1.4% of its total tree cover loss in the same time period (Global Forest Watch, n.d.). \nAlthough Singapore has signed a declaration that aims to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 (Singapore Business Review, 2021), there are yet to be any solid plans as to how it will be implemented. Additionally, to address the problem, we believe in the importance of acknowledging our impact on the wildlife and forests over the years.\n\n\n\nThe vegetation of Singapore (2011) - click on image to visit source"

However, what differentiates it from our current city centre is that JLD has been identified as a model for urban sustainability under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. The aim of the district thus extends beyond just promoting business, into supporting Singapore’s ambition to be a carbon services hub and a leading centre for green finance in Asia and globally. With the vision for a new and ‘green’ JLD, we hope to see a decrease or halt in the loss of vegetation as promised in that area.\n\nThus, to further educate ourselves and our peers on the environmental issues surrounding Singapore and its future developmental plans, we have decided to evaluate the current state of progress towards this vision by using JLD as our prime area of analysis. We conducted land cover change detection from 2018 to 2022 in JLD using Sentinel-2 satellite data, focusing on the loss of greenery to give way to new developments and possible forest preservation strategies in hopes of contributing to a greener Singapore."

    "text": "False Colour Composite\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - FCC images over 2018-2022\n\n\nFirstly, the False Colour Composite Scheme (FCC) is used to reveal or enhance features otherwise invisible or poorly visible to a human eye. FCC is most commonly used in assessing the plant density and their health, given that vegetation reflect near infrared and green light, while absorbing red. Given that they reflect more near infrared than green, plant-covered land appears deep red, with denser plant growth being a shade darker. The dark blue/black area represents the water body, and the lighter shades represent the urban built up places or bare land.\nIn Figure 1 above, We observe that there are the red areas denoting vegetation in each period over 2018-2022 is relatively significant and distinguishable. However, it is unfeasible to discern the changes in vegetation cover over the 5 years purely by observation using our naked eye.\n\n\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - NDVI images over 2018-2022\n\n\nWe also created normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) raster images, which is an indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, assessing whether or not the target being observed contains live green vegetation. How this works is that It normalizes the green leaf scattering in Near Infra-red wavelengths with chlorophyll absorption in red wavelengths. For Sentinel 2 data, we utilize Bands 4 (10m resolution, 665 nm wavelength, Red) and 8 (10m resolution, 842 nm wavelength, Visible and Near Infrared) to create the NDVI images, with the formula as shown below:\n\\[\nNDVI = \\frac{B8 - B4}{B8 + B4}\n\\]\nAs seen in Figure 2, the darker shades of green are strong indicators of vegetation. However, similar to Figure 1, it is difficult to discern the changes in vegetation cover over the 5 years purely by observation, which is the focus of our analysis.\n\n\nClassification using Random Forest\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Classification of raster layers from 2018 to 2022\n\n\nAs mentioned in our data preparation process, we classified each of the years using 5 different class categories (water body, vegetation, built up, bare land, impervious surfaces) to detect the extent of each of their land cover. The approach we used to obtain the classification is different from what was taught in class, where we complemented the SCP plugin (for obtain statistical results) with the use of another plugin known as Dzetsaka (to conduct the classification). The Dzetsaka plugin provided a greater array of supervised classification algorithms for us to utilize, including SVD, Random Forest, KNN and Gaussian Mixture Model. After testing the different algorithms for classification and evaluating their producer accuracy and kappa statistics (which we will discuss in greater depth later), we concluded that the Random Forest Classifier gives the most optimal results.\nThe Random Forest (RF) algorithm is a supervised classification algorithm, which builds upon the concept of decision trees, where it relies on many self-learning decision trees (i.e. \"Forest\"), so that many base learners can come to one strong and robust decision compared to a single decision tree. For more information on this particular algorithm for image classification, do visit this site here.\n\n\nClass-to-Class Change Analysis (2018 and 2022)\nWe next take a step further, by creating a visual representation of the change in class types between the years 2018 and 2022. The motivation behind this so that it is easier to observe the changes in land cover - particularly so to see what land covers have been changed to vegetation in the 5 years, and vice versa.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - Other classes to vegetation\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Vegetation to other classes\n\n\nJust by visually comparing between Figures 4 and 5, we can noticeably observe how the area of land cover change away from vegetation (Figure 5) is drastically greater than the area of land cover change to vegetation (Figure 4). More significantly, we observe in Figure 5 that a large extent of the land cover changes is from the loss of vegetation towards new built up areas, as denoted by the red pixels. This is in tandem with the hypothesis that more vegetated land spaces have been given way towards development of the Jurong Lake District.\n\n\nUnravelling the area of land cover change by class (km2)\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - land cover changes of different classes from 2018-2022 (in square kilometers)\n\n\nUsing the SCP post-processing classification report, we derive the area of land cover for each of the 5 classes over 2018-2022, with the numerical values representing the land area in \\(km^2\\) . Over the period of the 5 years, we observe that while the area of land cover for water body, bare land and impervious surfaces have remained relatively similar, there is a distinguishable and clear inverse relationship between vegetation and built-up areas. This is observed as the decrease in vegetation area by 3.08km² and increase in built-up area by 4.05km², This validates our hypothesis, given that land in Jurong Lake District is being zoned for transformation into the largest mixed-use business district outside of the city centre.\n\n\nEvaluating the accuracy of our results\nWe used 2 criteria to evaluate the accuracy and precision of our classification results, namely the Producer’s accuracy and the Kappa Statistic for each of the classes.\nProducer’s Accuracy\n\nRanging between 0-100%, the Producer’s Accuracy indicates how accurately the classification results meet the expectation of the creator. It is the probability that a certain land cover of an area on the ground is classified as such. In ensuring the accuracy of our classification is kept to a good standard, we benchmark our producer’s accuracy so that each of the classes achieved a minimum of around 70% for all the years.\n\nKappa Statistic of Agreement:\n\nRanging between -1 and 1, the Kappa Statistic measures the inter-rater reliability of the categorized classes, providing an overall assessment of classification’s accuracy, with 1 indicating perfect agreement. The formula for deriving the kappa statistic is as follows:\n\\[\nKappa = \\frac{Observed Agreement−Chance Agreement}{1 - Chance Agreement}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Statistical report of our classification\n\n\nFrom our statistical report in Figure 6, we have managed to achieve relatively high overall producer accuracy scores of >70% for all the classes. As the kappa statistic accounts for false negatives and false positives, there will be a natural tendency for its value to be lower than the producer accuracy. When evaluating the kappa statistic for the different classes, we have been able to achieve relatively high scores for water body, vegetation and built up areas, while the scores for bare land and impervious surfaces are not as great. This is likely attributed to the fact that there was relatively greater difficulty in obtaining the shapfile polygons for these 2 classes when classifying the training sample.\n\n\nAddressing some limitations and constraints of our analysis\n\nExistence of Cloud Cover in raster images\n\nOne of the major constraints we faced in classifying the raster data is the existence of cloud covers in the images, despite already selecting the best ‘cloud-free’ sentinel 2 dataset that can be found in the Copernicus Open Access Hub. The existence of the cloud cover limits our ability to accurately classify regions which are being covered by the clouds. Cloud masking is also an unfeasible method for the purposes of classification due to the algorithm still being unable to accurately predict the underlying land cover once the clouds are removed.\nOne of the potential methods to circumvent this, while acknowledging its limitations, is to conduct image mosaicing by obtaining raster data where the dates taken are very close to each other (e.g. days apart), and piece the parts together that are cloud free. The limitation of this method is that there could potentially still be significant land cover changes between the dates in which the raster images are taken for mosaicing.\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\nWe acknowledge that using remote sensing to analyze the land cover change and specifically the loss of vegetation to other land uses for urban development is all but just one part of the assessment of what it means to be a ‘sustainable hub’. There are embedded nuances in determining and assessing the environmental cost when in comes to development, including the materials used for buildings in that region, the technologies used in improving water and energy efficiency, and more.\nNonetheless, to achieve URA’s vision for JLD as a sustainable urban hub, a balance should still be struck between the preservation of existing greenery and the development of new built areas. This will minimise disruptions to the local biodiversity and reduce urban heat, all while acting as protection for the mental well-being of the local populace.\nIncorporating nature creatively within JLD’s mixed land use design could serve as a potential feasible solution towards reversing the loss of greenery. Taking inspiration from China’s Liuzhou Forest City, some novel ideas include greening every roof within the district, and cladding trees and plants over building façades (e.g. balconies).\nMicroforestry - also know as the Miyawaki Method for Creating Forests - is another concept which several cities (including The Netherlands) have adopted, which are forest the size of a tennis court that are being planted in every single neighborhood\nFundamentally, pushing feasible biophilic designs at the forefront of urban planning will certainly help to reduce the loss of nature at the expense of development.\n\n\nPotential Future Work\n\nUrban Heat Island Effect\nUrban heat island effect occurs when cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. which increases regional temperature and energy costs. There is a strong correlation between the loss of vegetation and the corresponding increase in urban heat temperature within the same area. In our future work, we can utilize the QGIS tools analyze the extent of land temperature change over 2018-2022 in relation to the increased loss in vegetation in JLD.\n\n\n\nMacro-Analysis of Parks\nAs our current scope only covers Jurong Lake District, we can expand our analysis to study land cover change in other key areas identified by the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Under the City in Nature initiative, the government aims to increase nature parks’ land area by over 50% within 10 years. By incorporating the methods used in our study, we can supplement current knowledge by investigating trends in land cover change in newly planned nature park areas."
