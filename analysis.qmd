# Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

The **normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)** is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, often from a space platform, assessing whether or not the target being observed contains live green vegetation.

$$
NDVI = \frac{B8 - B4}{B8 + B4}
$$

# Evaluating the accuracy of our results

Producer's Accuracy

-   Ranging between 0-100%, the Producer's Accuracy indicates how accurately the classification results meet the expectation of the creator. It is the probability that a certain land cover of an area on the ground is classified as such.

Kappa Statistic of Agreement:

-   Ranging between -1 and 1, the Kappa Statistic measures the inter-rater reliability of the categorised classes, providing an overall assessment of classification's accuracy, with 1 indicating perfect agreement. It is derived as (observed agreement−chance agreement)/(1−chance agreement).
